# Buildings and Energy Analysis
This report is to analyze the dataset (2015 Building Energy Benchmarking) from the Seattle city providing to the public. From the dataset, we hope to find out:
1) buildings in Seattle that are above the benchmarking in energy use
2) building types in geographical distribution in relation to green-house gas emission
3) prediction of green-house gas emission from a building in respect to its features, such as property type, gross floor area (GFA), energy (electricity, natural gas and steam) use, location, building age etc. 

Details for the report:
1) python codes via Jupyter Notebook
2) sql codes via MS sql server (using the dataset to develop a database into MS sql server for this project use)
3) an analystic presentation for this project in pdf
